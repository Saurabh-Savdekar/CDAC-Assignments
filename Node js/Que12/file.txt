1)New Technologies and Research :-
    Humans did not evolve to go into space, but we go there anyway. That has led to the development of various technologies that     feed back into the economy and improve our lives on Earth. Without space programs, we wouldn’t have GPS, accurate weather     prediction, solar cells, or the ultraviolet filters in sunglasses and cameras. There’s also medical research happening in space     right now that could cure diseases and prolong human lives, and these experiments can’t be done on Earth. Space exploration     could save your life.

2)Asteroids and Comets Don’t Care About Us :
    Speaking of saving lives, space exploration could save all our lives. Our solar system has calmed down a lot since the early     eons, but there are still uncountable big asteroids and comets out there that could smack into the planet and really ruin your     day. It’s happened several times in the past, each one causing a mass extinction. It’s not a matter of if another large asteroid     hits Earth, but when. A robust space program is the only hope we have of deflecting such an object.

3)Space Mining Could Save the World :
    As we develop new technologies on Earth, the strain on our natural resources continues to increase. The extraction of valuable     minerals has led to a host of problems, including environmental damage and human exploitation, but there’s a wealth of precious     materials in space. Startups like Planetary Resources want to mine asteroids instead of Earth, which would mean an effectively     unlimited supply of raw materials that are rare on Earth.
